{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block body %}
    hello
{% endblock %}
<!--
NOTES:
The extends syntax lets you build off of other html file.
Important: Do not foget quotes around filename

Here, the block syntax lets u add html which then gets added to
layout.html (the file being extended, in this case)
